          I'm a software engineer with a strong foundation in building
          thoughtful, reliable systems, from designing clean APIs and managing
          data, to collaborating across the stack to bring products to life. I
          enjoy tackling complex problems and translating them into elegant,
          performant products. I thrive in collaborative environments and am
          always learning new technologies to push my skills further.
